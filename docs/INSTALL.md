**Read [SAFETY.md](../SAFETY.md) before you start.** This software drives a
motorised treadmill.

To undo everything: factory reset the console.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| A treadmill | NordicTrack or ProForm, FitPro motor board, Android console. Check [Step 0](#step-0-check-your-treadmill). |
| A computer | macOS or Linux, with `adb` and Python 3.9+. |
| JDK 17 + Android SDK | Only if you build it yourself. There is a [signed APK](https://github.com/keranm/strideApp/releases/latest) if you would rather not — see [1.7](#17-install-stride). |
| Home Assistant | Optional. Needs an MQTT broker. |
| An iPhone | Optional. Apple Health only. |

Allow about an hour for Part 1, ten minutes for Part 2.

Parts 2 and 3 are optional. Stop after Part 1 and the treadmill works with no
subscription.

---

## Step 0. Check your treadmill

STRIDE is confirmed on one machine:

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | NordicTrack C 1750 |
| Generation | Gen 6, the "CLASSIC" embedded console |
| GlassOS | 8.51.7.1070 |
| System version | EKA2_20221110 |
| Firmware | 84.121 |
| Motor board | FitPro, device id `0x04` |
| Ranges reported | incline -3 to +12 %, speed 1.6 to 20 km/h |

- **Likely to work:** other Gen 6 NordicTrack and ProForm consoles on a FitPro board.
- **Unknown:** Gen 7 / iFit 2.0. Reported not to work, untested here.
- **Required:** an Android console you can reach with `adb`.

What you can check right now, on the console's own screen:

1. Go to **Settings → About tablet**.
2. Read **Build number**. This machine reports `EKA2_20221110`.
3. Read **Android version**. This machine is on Android 9.

You cannot identify the motor board yet. That needs ADB and the iFit software
out of the way, so it happens in [step 1.6](#16-identify-the-motor-board).

[Open an issue](https://github.com/keranm/strideApp/issues) with what you find,
working or not.

## Part 1. The console

### 1.1 Factory reset

1. Find the pinhole reset button. Look for a single small hole on the side
   panel or the top of the console.
2. Hold the pinhole in while you switch the treadmill on at the power switch.
3. Wait for *System recovery* in blue text.
4. Let it finish. Takes five to ten minutes.
5. Do not join Wi-Fi yet. Stay offline until iFit is disabled in step 1.3.

### 1.2 Enable privileged mode

On the iFit welcome screen:

1. Tap a blank area of the screen ten times.
2. Wait seven seconds. Nothing appears during the pause.
3. Tap the same spot ten more times.
4. The console shows a challenge code. Get the matching response code, either
   by ringing NordicTrack support and asking for one, or from a third-party
   calculator such as <https://getresponsecode.com> (no connection to this
   project).
5. Enter the response code.
6. The console opens the default Android apps screen. Tap **Settings**.

### 1.3 Stop iFit locking you out again

Do this before anything else. Skipping it undoes every later step at the next
reboot.

Open **Settings → Apps**. Deal with two apps.

**iFit Admin** (`com.ifit.eru`):

1. Tap **Force stop**.
2. Go to **Settings → Apps → Special access → Display over other apps**.
3. Set iFit Admin to **Not allowed**.
4. Go to **Settings → Apps → Special access → Modify system settings**.
5. Set iFit Admin to off.

![iFit Admin app info](screenshots/install-ifit-admin.png)

![Display over other apps](screenshots/install-display-over-other-apps.png)

iFit Admin is a system app and cannot be uninstalled. Force stop plus those two
permissions is as far as it goes.

**iFit** (`com.ifit.standalone`):

1. Tap **Force stop**.
2. Tap **Uninstall**.

![iFit app info](screenshots/install-ifit-app.png)

### 1.4 Enable ADB over Wi-Fi

1. Go to **Settings → About tablet**.
2. Tap **Build number** seven times.

   ![Build number](screenshots/install-build-number.png)

   Tapping Build number seven times is what turns on Developer Mode. After
   about four taps the console starts counting down how many taps are left,
   and confirms that Developer Mode is enabled on the seventh.

3. Go to **Settings → Developer options**.

   ![Developer options](screenshots/install-developer-options.png)

4. Turn on **USB debugging**.

   ![USB debugging](screenshots/install-usb-debugging.png)

5. Pull down the notification panel, long-press **Wi-Fi**, and join your network.
6. Go to **Settings → About tablet** and read the **IP address**.

   ![IP address](screenshots/install-ip-address.png)

On your computer:

```sh
adb connect <console-ip>:5555
adb devices
```

✅ The console lists as `device`, not `unauthorized` or `offline`.

Do not turn USB debugging off afterwards.

### 1.5 Read unchain.sh before running it

[`tools/unchain.sh`](../tools/unchain.sh) does five things in order:

1. Disables `com.ifit.eru` and denies it `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` and `WRITE_SETTINGS`.
2. Disables the remaining iFit packages.
3. Turns on developer settings and keeps the screen awake.
4. Installs a launcher.
5. Installs STRIDE if you have built it, and sets it as the home app.

Run it with `STRIDE_KIOSK=0` to skip step 5. The script prints the command that
undoes the home-app change.

```sh
./tools/unchain.sh
```

> The console's USB port is the link to the motor board, so Wi-Fi ADB is
> usually your only way in. Whether it survives a power cycle varies by
> console. Test yours before relying on it. STRIDE itself needs no ADB to run.

### 1.6 Identify the motor board

`console/usbprobe` asks the board what it is. It reads and writes nothing.

```sh
cd console/usbprobe
./run.sh
```

Read the result on the console's screen.

✅ It names a board and a device id. This machine reports FitPro, device `0x04`,
incline -3 to +12 %, speed 1.6 to 20 km/h.

If it says the device is claimed, `com.ifit.eru` is running again. Re-run
`tools/unchain.sh`.

**[Open an issue](https://github.com/keranm/strideApp/issues) with what it
says,** working or not. A list of known-good boards is the most useful thing
this project could have and it does not exist yet.

### 1.7 Install STRIDE

Two ways in. They end at the same screen, so take whichever suits — but read
the last paragraph before picking, because moving between them later costs you
your settings.

#### Option A — install the released APK

Nothing to build. You need `adb`, which you already have from step 1.4.

Download the APK from
[the latest release](https://github.com/keranm/strideApp/releases/latest), then:

```sh
adb install -r stride-*.apk
adb shell am start -n dev.stride.hud/.MainActivity
```

To check what you downloaded, use the certificate rather than a file hash. The
hash changes every release; the certificate does not. Every build published
here is signed by `CN=STRIDE, O=The Idea Works, C=AU`, SHA-256
`274a6f2e308df50e1e4219f5bd1f4aca5fda8ccd5feccc7c52579c0c8dd302e8`:

```sh
apksigner verify --print-certs stride-*.apk
```

Anything else did not come from here.

It ships with no broker credentials of anyone's — they are compiled out, and
the console is where you set your own in step 2.1.

#### Option B — build it yourself

You need JDK 17 and the Android SDK.

```sh
cd console/stride
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` builds, installs, launches, and tails the log. It finds the Android
SDK via `ANDROID_HOME` or `~/Library/Android/sdk`.

**Read what it prints.** Without a signing key in `local.properties` it builds
a *debug* APK and says so. A debug build is `debuggable`, which lets anything
else on the console read this app's stored settings — broker password
included — and it opens the WebView DevTools socket. That is fine on a bench
and is not what you want on a machine that sits in a hallway for years. To
build the same thing the release is, generate a key and use `./run.sh release`;
the four properties are documented at the top of
`console/stride/app/build.gradle.kts`.

#### Pick one and stay on it

Android identifies an app by its signing key, so a build of yours and the
released APK are different apps as far as the console is concerned. Installing
one over the other fails with a signature mismatch, and the only way across is
`adb uninstall dev.stride.hud` first — which takes your settings, your people
and your workout history with it.

✅ Either way: the console shows the STRIDE welcome screen, and the log prints
`limits: <min>..<max> km/h, <min>..<max> %`.

### 1.8 Set up STRIDE

Everything is on the treadmill's own screen. There are no config files.

- **Settings → Who walks.** Add yourself. Nobody is pre-configured.
- **Settings → Treadmill.** Units, warm-up, cool-down, guided-walk speed limit.
- **Settings → Interface.** Pick one of five. *Original* is the most tested.

✅ Clip the safety key, choose a workout, and check the belt starts and the
distance climbs.

**Stop here if you do not use Home Assistant.**

---

## Part 2. Home Assistant

### 2.1 Connect the treadmill

Requires the [MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/)
and a broker. Nothing from this repository is installed for this step.

1. On the console, go to **Settings → Home Assistant**.
2. Enter broker host, port, username, password.
3. Tap **Test**.

✅ A **Treadmill** device appears under Settings → Devices with speed, incline,
distance, elapsed, pulse, calories, mode and workout. A second device appears
per person the first time they walk.

Build whatever dashboard you like from those entities. There is no custom
component to install.

### 2.2 Optional: weekly and monthly totals

The console's distance counter resets every walk, so totals accumulate in Home
Assistant.

1. Copy [`homeassistant/packages/stride.yaml`](../homeassistant/packages/stride.yaml)
   into your config as `packages/stride.yaml`.
2. Add to `configuration.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   homeassistant:
     packages: !include_dir_named packages
   ```

3. Restart Home Assistant.

✅ `sensor.treadmill_distance_weekly` exists and is not `unavailable`.

If it is unavailable, your treadmill device is named something other than
`Treadmill`. Set `treadmill_prefix` in `stride.conf` and the `source:` lines in
the package to match.

> **Gap:** this file is valid YAML and mirrors a working configuration, but has
> not been installed on a clean Home Assistant.

### 2.3 Optional: the coach and reminders

```sh
cd homeassistant
cp stride.conf.example stride.conf
```

1. Open `stride.conf`. Every key is documented in the file. Leave a key blank to
   skip that subject.
2. Set `coach_ai_task`. Find your AI entity under Developer Tools → States,
   prefix `ai_task.`.
3. Run what you want:

   ```sh
   python3 stride_coach_llm.py      # coach, and the automations that fire it
   python3 stride_reminders.py      # weigh-in and blood-pressure reminders
   python3 stride_persons.py        # publishes your HA people to the console
   ```

✅ `script.stride_coach` exists. Run it with `kind: morning` and a `task`, and a
message appears on `sensor.stride_coach`.

After `stride_persons.py`, the console's **Settings → Who walks** lists your
Home Assistant people under *From Home Assistant*.

### 2.4 Optional: sending the walk files somewhere

The console can write out every walk as two files — a CSV of every second and
a summary — and POST both to a listener on your network when the walk ends.
Off by default; there is a switch for it under **Settings → Walk log**.

The receiving end is
[`homeassistant/stride_walk_listener.py`](../homeassistant/stride_walk_listener.py).
It is a small standalone HTTP server, standard library only.

1. On any machine on your network, from the `homeassistant` directory:

   ```sh
   python3 stride_walk_listener.py
   ```

   It prints the address to point the console at, and where it is keeping the
   walks. `walk_log_dir`, `walk_listener_host` and `walk_listener_port` in
   `stride.conf` change those.

2. On the console, go to **Settings → Walk log**. Turn **Send my walks** on
   and enter the address it printed, including the path:

   ```
   http://<that machine>:8099/walk
   ```

3. Tap **SEND NOW**. The console has nothing waiting yet, so this is mostly a
   check that the address is right.

✅ After a walk, two files appear in the walk directory, named with the same
walk id.

If the listener is switched off when a walk ends, the files stay on the
console and are sent at the end of the next walk instead. Nothing is lost and
nothing is sent twice.

> The listener takes files from the network and writes them to disk, so run it
> on a machine you trust, on a network you trust. There is no
> authentication on it and none is offered.

## Part 3. Apple Health (iPhone)

Optional. Nothing else depends on it.

Use **[AH for HA](https://github.com/keranm/ah-for-ha)**, which is a separate
project with its own guide. There is nothing in this repository to install for
it.

AH for HA also publishes outdoor walks as gradient profiles over MQTT, which
STRIDE replays on the deck.

> `homeassistant/stride_health_webhook.py` is frozen. Setting this up for the
> first time? You do not need it.

---

## If it goes wrong

1. Pull the safety key.
2. Switch the treadmill off at the wall.
3. To restore the manufacturer's software, factory reset from the console's own
   recovery.

## Credit

Steps 1.1 to 1.4 follow a community *NordicTrack Gen 6 modding guide*. That
guide heads towards QZ Companion. STRIDE goes a different way after 1.4.

## Testing this guide

Most likely to be wrong:

- **Steps 1.1 to 1.4.** Written up after the fact. Nobody has followed this page
  on a freshly reset machine.
- **Step 2.2.** Never installed on a clean Home Assistant.
- **Step 2.4.** The listener has been run and its files read, but the console's
  side of it has not been walked through end to end on a treadmill.
- **Every ✅ check.** If one does not happen, that is the bug.
- **Anything you had to work out that is not written down.**

Open an issue. "Stuck at 1.1 on a 2019 Commercial 1750" is useful.
